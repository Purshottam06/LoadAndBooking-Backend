# LoadAndBooking-Backend

This is a Spring Boot application to manage **load** and **booking** operations efficiently.  
It provides RESTful APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD), as well as accepting and rejecting bookings.  
It also manages load details such as source, destination, quantity, and truck type to facilitate smooth logistics operations.  

**Booking operations are dependent on existing loads**, meaning a booking can only be created for a valid load.

|--------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/booking`                     | Create a new booking           |
| GET    | `/api/booking`                     | Fetch bookings (filter by `shipperId`, `transporterId`) |
| GET    | `/api/booking/{bookingId}`         | Get booking details            |

## ðŸ“Œ Rules

- Load `status` should default to `POSTED` when created.  
- When a booking is made (`POST /booking`), its status should be set to `BOOKED`.  
- If a booking is deleted, the associated loadâ€™s status should become `CANCELLED`.  
- A booking **should not** be created if the load is already `CANCELLED`.  
- When a booking is accepted, its status becomes `ACCEPTED`.

---

## âœ… Assumptions

- **Accept or Reject Bookings**:  
  Use `/accept/{bookingId}` to **accept** a booking, and  
  `/reject/{bookingId}` to **reject** a booking.

- **Filtering Loads or Bookings**:  
  Use query parameters such as `shipperId`, `truckType` for loads, and  
  `shipperId`, `transporterId` for bookings when using GET requests.

- **Booking Depends on Load**:  
  A booking must be linked to an existing load.

- **UUID Format**:  
  All IDs (`loadId`, `bookingId`) are UUIDs.
